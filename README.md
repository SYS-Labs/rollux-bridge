# Features

## Deposits

Users can easily deposit tokens to L2 with low fees and high speed by clicking a couple of buttons.

## Withdrawals

Users can easily withdraw funds from L2 to L1, but this involves a waiting period of 2 hours (the testnet is faster). There are already proposals in place for third-party providers to facilitate faster withdrawals.

The full withdrawal process, which includes initiating, proving, and finalizing the withdrawal, is all covered by the bridge's user interface.

## Add token to the wallet

In the "Select Token" popup, users can add a token to their wallet watchlist with just one click.

## Deploy L2 mintable ERC20 or ERC721

The bridge supports deployment through MintableTokenFactory with just a few clicks. You can find this option under `Account modal -> Bridge your token.`
